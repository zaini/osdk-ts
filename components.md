# OSDK React Components

Source: https://older.zaini.me/osdk-ts/components

> @osdk/react-components provides Ontology-aware React components that take OSDK types and handle data loading, caching, and state for you.

The components are built on [`@osdk/react`](https://palantir.github.io/osdk-ts/react/objects) and use its hooks internally. Use `@osdk/react` when you need low-level data hooks, and `@osdk/react-components` when you want ready-made UI for tables, forms, filters, and media.

## Components

Each component has its own import path.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install @osdk/react-components @osdk/react @osdk/client @osdk/api @osdk/oauth react react-dom classnames
```

```tsx
import { Employee } from "@my-app/sdk";
import { ObjectTable } from "@osdk/react-components/object-table";

function EmployeeDirectory() {
  return <ObjectTable objectType={Employee} />;
}
```

Components need an `OsdkProvider` above them and the package styles imported into a CSS layer. See [Prerequisites](https://older.zaini.me/osdk-ts/components/prerequisites.md) for the full setup.
