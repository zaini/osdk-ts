> Build reactive Foundry apps with @osdk/react hooks backed by one shared, normalized cache.

`@osdk/react` wraps the OSDK client in hooks. Every hook reads from one normalized cache, so a list, a detail view, and a link panel that show the same object stay in sync, and an action updates them all without manual refetching.

```tsx title="src/EmployeeList.tsx"
import { useOsdkObjects } from "@osdk/react";
import { Employee } from "@my-app/sdk";

export function EmployeeList() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useOsdkObjects(Employee, {
    where: { department: "Engineering" },
    orderBy: { fullName: "asc" },
  });

  return (
    <section aria-busy={isLoading}>
      {error != null && <p role="alert">Could not load employees.</p>}
      <ul>
        {data?.map((employee) => (
          <li key={employee.$primaryKey}>{employee.fullName}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
}
```

- [Loading and errors](https://older.zaini.me/osdk-ts/concepts/loading-and-errors.md): Render without flashing while data refreshes.
- [Optimistic updates](https://older.zaini.me/osdk-ts/react/optimistic-updates.md): Show the result of an action before the server confirms it.
- [Devtools](https://older.zaini.me/osdk-ts/devtools.md): Inspect the cache, queries, and actions in your running app.
